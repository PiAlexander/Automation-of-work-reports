# Automation-of-work-reports


## Introduction
Today we do __most__ of our routine work without even thinking,
but invest in these tasks too many time.
For example, in my current company every monday we make only reports
and presentation preparations the whole day.
Most of these tasks we can automate __easily__, so, why not to?


## What am I doing in this repository:
* describe sense of report(__what__ need to do)
* provide code(__how__ I did it)
* show the difference of execution time(__before__ / __after__ automation) 


## My goals here:
* automate time-expensive / boring tasks
* improve __data visualization__ part of these reports
* continue learn __python__
* get used and start to use __pandas__ for data analysis instead of
  traditional Excel
* learn how to __visualize__ data with __matplotlib__ and __seaborn__
* get familiar with __github__ flow
* get familiar with __Git__
* start and fill __portfolio__


## Reports planned:
- [ ] indicator 45/60 days
- [ ] indicator promo
- [ ] schedule performance
- [ ] bundling in time
- [ ] effectiveness of flows
